# will use same as Max variable names and default values in case I need to compare code

   - Video 115 Handling Events.
     - Handle click event in input form
       - Name it resetHandler()
     - Handle submit event in input form
       - Note: add submit event to form html tag --done
       - Name it submitHandler()
     - Handle onChange event in input form
       - Name it inputChangeHandler()
       - Make it reusable for all input
       - use 'input' and 'value' arguments
       - tested it, results displayed as expected in console
   - Video 116 Manage State
     - create variable for default values of initial state
     - name it initialUser Input
       - current-savings default value: 10000
       - contribution: 1200
       - return rate: 7
       - duration: 10
     - use one state for all inputs
       - Note: use object key value pairs . !this is actually done by extracting default values in separated variable
       - use userInput and setUserInput as names for variables in state
     - update state in input and reset events
       - Note: remember sometimes state depends on previous state
       - use prevInput as name
     - setup two way binding
       - Note: do that in input tag by adding value property
       - Take out in two way binding value is set to state variable
   - Video 117 lift State up
     - link UserInput and App.js using props and calculateHandler function
       - Name it onCalculate
     - store yearly data as State
       - name state variables userInput and setUserInput
       - set default state to null
       - ! don't forget to check if userInput initial data exists
   - Video 118 output yearly data conditionally
     - Use logical AND for dynamical display info
       - add new prop to ResultsTable component and name it data
       - in ResultsTable.js output data using map(). Note: don't forget key props. Use year as id
       - add new prop to ResultsTable component and name it initialInvestment
       - interest calculation formula: savings - initial investment - yearly contribution multiplied by the year
       - total invested capital formula: initial investment - yearly contribution multiplied by the year
       - use formatter.format() to format currency output
   - All <tr> and <td> tags look very ugly, let's try to do it with grid
